      <h2>Rules of friendly design</h2>
      <p>
        Over many years of experience in producing
        <strong>user-friendly interfaces</strong>, we have learned three simple
        rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design should be as clear as possible</li>
        <li>All controls of interaction must be comfortable</li>
        <li>Accessibility for any person and device</li>
      </ul>
