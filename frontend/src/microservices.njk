        Microservices <strong>allow your business</strong> to accept more and
        more orders. Even the most intuitive and user-friendly interface will
        not work, unless there is a <strong>secure</strong> and
        <strong>stable</strong> backend behind it.

      <h2>Advantages of a microservice basis</h2>
      <p>
        Over many years of experience in producing
        <strong>user-friendly interfaces</strong>, we have learned three simple
        rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design should be as clear as possible</li>
        <li>All controls of interaction must be comfortable</li>
        <li>Accessibility for any person and device</li>
      </ul>
