      <h2>How do we do this?</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, we are developers who know a lot about DX and support
        large projects in the long run. Therefore, all of our projects have
        <strong>excellent</strong>
        documentation and
        <strong>clear</strong>
        code. It's important!
      </p>
      <p>
        The simple magic is based on
        <strong>Go</strong>
        (Golang),
        <strong>Python</strong>, modern
        <strong>JavaScript</strong>
        and
        <strong>CSS</strong>. Fast and secure delivery of developed web apps and
        microservices to any servers by
        <strong>Docker</strong>
        containers.
