      <h2>How do we do this?</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, we are developers who know a lot about DX and support
        large projects in the long run. Therefore, all of our projects have
        <strong>excellent</strong> documentation and <strong>clear</strong>
        code. It's important!
      </p>
      <p>
        The simple magic is based on <strong>Golang</strong>, modern
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. Fast and secure
        delivery of developed web apps and microservices to any servers by
        <strong>Docker</strong> containers.
